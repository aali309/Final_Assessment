            <p class="reflection">Responsive web design is the design of web pages that provide a great experience on a variety of devices connected to the Internet. This means that one and the same site can be viewed on a variety of devices, regardless of the resolution and screen format - smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc. At the same time, viewing will be equally convenient for all formats - users of mobile devices, for example, will not need to expand individual areas of the site so as not to miss the desired link. Responsive design aims to make web pages and the display of their content match the device from which they are viewed. Today, users use a wide variety of devices with which to access the Internet - they all differ in screen size and resolution, so the website will be displayed differently on each of them. The popularity of mobile devices continues to grow at a rapid pace, Internet traffic is increasing, so a significant part of the audience of any company browses the site from smartphones or tablets. If urgent information often appears on your resource, which the user can read at any time on the phone, then it is best to use responsive design. The main benefits of responsive web design are the following: Audience coverage and promotion - resources created using this technology are better ranked by search engines, therefore, they are distinguished by more effective promotion. You will not lose visitors and potential customer, users close a page if it takes a long time to load on a mobile device, and thanks to the responsive design, this problem can be easily solved. The competitiveness of the site is also important. With the help of responsive design, you will be able to significantly outperform your competitors, attract more users, and overtake even major players. Throughout the course I've learned to design web pages using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. JavaScript helped me a lot build dynamic pages.</p>
